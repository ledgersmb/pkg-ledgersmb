debian/TODO for LedgerSMB v1.3


====================================================================================================

- If an automatic configuration is attempted during the package install, the default database
administrative user 'ledgersmb' is not being configured with the correct permissions. See also:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1078817
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=698298

- http://i18n.debian.org/l10n-pkg-status/l/ledgersmb.html shows the following error:
msgfmt: found 1 fatal error, "Duplicate message definition in locale/po/es_AR.po"
https://sourceforge.net/p/ledger-smb/bugs/1096/

- A debian/po debconf Japanese translation has been provided. Currently,
there is no LSMB locale/po/ja.po file. Checked System|Lanaguage|List
Languages in LSMB 1.3.25: "ja" is not in the default list. It's also not
listed as an available language when editing templates, and presumably
those lists come from the same source. It can be added manually using
System|Language|Add Language.

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create the distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from
the source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to
create an HTML version?

- Create an HTML and/or PDF file of templateing/templating-guide.tex? And
then register it with doc-base?

- Add registration of at least database/ledgersmb.html to doc-base?

- Add an installation option for a versioned installation directory name?
Or add a package build time option to create a versioned package name and
installation? Or change to using at least binary package names that also
include info about the version, like "ledgersmb13" or "ledgersmb1.4" or
"ledgersmb-1.3"?
