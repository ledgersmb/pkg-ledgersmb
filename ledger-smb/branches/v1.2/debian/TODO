debian/TODO for LedgerSMB v1.2


- Review updates & changes to v1.3, backport anything useful or needed for v.1.2

- Add an apache2 restart to postinst, now that the softlink to the LSMB httpd
configuration is being installed automatically?

- Update/expand the information provided in the debian/patches files.

- As neccessary, add any other docs that could be registered to doc-base files.
For instance;  FAQ.html (done), others?

- Autoconfiguration for PostgreSQL and access to it by LedgerSMB

- Suppress and/or otherwise handle the multiple instances of the following
Lintian warnings:
W: ledgersmb: executable-not-elf-or-script  (various directories)
W: ledgersmb: extra-license-file usr/share/ledgersmb/locale/legacy/

- It was announced back in Sept 2010 that LSMB v1.2 works with Postgresql v9,
which is now available in Debian Testing (wheezy). After testing that version
with LSMB, add v9.0 to the possible Postgresql versions in debian/control?
