debian/TODO for LedgerSMB v1.3


- Add a section in README.Debian about how HTML, LaTeX, and Text templates are
handled now?

- The application UPGRADE file does not really need to be installed with the
package?; any useful information should be moved to README.Debian.

- The dbconfig configuration is apparently capable of creating the ledgersmb
user but it is not getting created with the necessary permissions. It is also
apparently automatically creating a database named ledgersmb when it creates
that user.  The owner of it can come up as postgres; should make that
ledgersmb, if that database is even needed.

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from the
source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to create
an HTML version?

- Create an HTML and/or PDF file of templateing/templating-guide.tex?

- Add registration of at least database/ledgersmb.html to doc-base?

- Review the tools/* shell and perl scripts to see what if any need changes for
usage on a Debian installation.

- The package installs the LedgerSMB css directory to /var/lib/ledgersmb/css,
but the application itself currently expects it to be in the main installation
directory; reference also upstream bug # 3516730. Fixed with v1.3.18? (A symbolic
link pointing to it is installed with the current packaging as a workaround for
the issue.)

- New 1.3 version of LedgerSMB contains an embedded javascript library. The
embedded version appears to be 1.8.2.  The library is available in Debian as the
package libjs-scriptaculous:  v1.8.1 in lenny, v1.8.3 in lenny-backports and
squeeze, v1.9.0 in wheezy and sid. Provide a Lintian override with description
of issue, until otherwise resolved.
  From Chris Travers in the Ledger-smb-devel mailing list:
  "I don't know of any testing we have done on other versions.  We don't use a
   lot of advanced stuff so I would expect it would work.  If bugs are found,
   though, we can correct them."
Test usage of libjs-scriptaculous and change over to using that when it is found
to be operational with it.
-> Instead of patching the files that use it directly, try using dh_linktree to
create the set of links to the debian packages.
