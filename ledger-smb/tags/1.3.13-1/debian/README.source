Note that an original source archive is created by downloading the archive for
version n.n.nn as ledgersmb-n.n.nn.tar.gz and its associated gpg signature file
ledgersmb-n.n.nn.tar.gz.asc. The file is verified against the signature and it
is then renamed as ledgersmb_n.n.nn.orig.tar.gz.

Please read /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source to know how to apply
and manage Debian specific patches on this package.
