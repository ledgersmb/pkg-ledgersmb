debian/TODO for LedgerSMB v1.3



- Lintian Info ledgersmb: I unused-override, package-contains-empty-directory.
Don't know why that's coming up because the two listed directories are being
installed with the package and they are empty. Possibly an issue with how
they're entered in the file. 

- Auto-configuration of PostgreSQL and access to it by LedgerSMB using dbconfig-common.
First;  check if manual or assisted configuration.  If assisted, create ledgersmb
postgresql user as LedgerSMB admin.  If manual;  msg about docs for manual set up?

- If the tools/prepare-company-database.sh script is to be usable on the Debian
installation, it will need to be patched. For instance:  Lines 199 and 200 (as
of 1.3.12) are used in the script to create ledgersmb-httpd.conf from the
ledgersmb-httpd.conf.template apparantly each time it runs. Current Debian
install does not have either the template file or the working file in the place
it expects and in any case the debian package install takes care of those.

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from the
source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to create
an HTML version?

- The templates directory had been getting installed to /etc/ledgersmb/templates.
Should that be /var/lib/ledgersmb/templates instead?

- New 1.3 version of LedgerSMB contains an embedded javascript library. The embedded
version appears to be 1.8.2.  The library is available in Debian as the package
libjs-scriptaculous:  v1.8.1 in lenny (current oldstable), v1.8.3 in lenny-backports,
v1.8.3 in squeeze, v1.9.0 in wheezy. Provide a Lintian override with description of
issue, until otherwise resolved.
  From Chris Travers in the Ledger-smb-devel mailing list:
  "I don't know of any testing we have done on other versions.  We don't use a lot
   of advanced stuff so I would expect it would work.  If bugs are found, though,
   we can correct them."
Test usage of libjs-scriptaculous and change over to using that when it is found
to be operational with it.
