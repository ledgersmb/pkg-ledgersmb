debian/TODO for LedgerSMB v1.3

- The dbconfig configuration is apparantly capable of creating the ledgersmb
user but it is not getting created with the necessary permissions.

- The dbconfig configuration is apparantly automatically creating a database
named ledgersmb when it creates the ledgersmb user.  The owner of it can 
come up as postgres;  should make that ledgersmb.

- Review the tools/* shell and perl scripts to see what if any need changes for
usage on a debian installation.

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from the
source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to create
an HTML version?

- The package installs the LedgerSMB css directory to /var/lib/ledgersmb/css,
but the application itself currently expects it to be in the main installation
directory; reference also upstream bug # 3516730. (A symbolic link is installed
with the current packaging as a workaround for the issue.)

- The templates directory had been getting installed to /etc/ledgersmb/templates.
Should that be /var/lib/ledgersmb/templates instead? (There is also an issue 
with editing templates online; reference upstream bug # 3516725 regarding that.)

- New 1.3 version of LedgerSMB contains an embedded javascript library. The
embedded version appears to be 1.8.2.  The library is available in Debian as the
package libjs-scriptaculous:  v1.8.1 in lenny (current oldstable), v1.8.3 in
lenny-backports, v1.8.3 in squeeze, v1.9.0 in wheezy. Provide a Lintian override
with description of issue, until otherwise resolved.
  From Chris Travers in the Ledger-smb-devel mailing list:
  "I don't know of any testing we have done on other versions.  We don't use a
   lot of advanced stuff so I would expect it would work.  If bugs are found,
   though, we can correct them."
Test usage of libjs-scriptaculous and change over to using that when it is found
to be operational with it.

- Apache v2.4 was released in February 2012 and is being prepared for upload into
Debian. Ref: http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/03/msg00013.html
at least regarding packaging guidelines.
