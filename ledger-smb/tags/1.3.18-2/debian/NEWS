ledgersmb (1.3.18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Empty language specific HTML, LaTeX, and Text directories are no longer being
  installed with the package. In order to edit templates online for a particular
  language; create the language specific directory, like templates/demo/en_US,
  then manually copy the default version of the template to that directory.

  The application css directory is /var/lib/ledgersmb/css and the default files
  for it are now installed there from the example files during an initial package
  install. There is also a new URL related configuration item in ledgersmb.conf,
  cssdir, which will need to be updated manually when upgrading from a previous
  version.

ledgersmb (1.3.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The templates directory is now at /var/lib/ledgersmb/templates instead of
  being at /etc/ledgersmb/templates. For upgrades, the templates path in
  /etc/ledgersmb/ledgersmb.conf will need to be updated manually.

ledgersmb (1.3.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Now have experimental dbconfig/debconf usage for configuring LedgerSMB during
  the package installation.  Because it is experimental, the default is to not
  use it;  instead what can be done is to manually create the ledgersmb database
  user and use that in the http://localhost/ledgersmb/setup.pl script to create
  the company databases for use. More information regarding this is available
  in /usr/share/doc/ledgersmb/README.Debian.
