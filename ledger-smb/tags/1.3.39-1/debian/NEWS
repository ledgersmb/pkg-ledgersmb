ledgersmb (1.3.39-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Language specific HTML, LaTeX, and Text templates can be edited online but
  the language specific directory (like /var/ledgersmb/templates/demo/en_US)
  first needs to be manually created and the template file copied there.

  An experimental dbconfig/debconf for configuring LedgerSMB during the package
  installation is available. Because it is experimental, the default is to not
  use it; instead what can be done is to manually create the ledgersmb database
  user and use that in the http://localhost/ledgersmb/setup.pl script to create
  the company databases for use. More information regarding this is available
  in /usr/share/doc/ledgersmb/README.Debian.

  The contrib_dir configuration in /etc/ledgersmb/ledgersmb.conf now defaults
  to being for Postgresql 9.3, and should be updated if being used with a
  different version.
