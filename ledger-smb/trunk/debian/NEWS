ledgersmb (1.3.16-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Now have experimental dbconfig/debconf usage for configuring LedgerSMB during
  the package installation.  Because it is experimental, the default is to not
  use it;  instead what can be done is to manually create the ledgersmb database
  user and use that in the http://localhost/ledgersmb/setup.pl script to create
  the company databases for use. More information regarding this is available
  in /usr/share/doc/ledgersmb/README.Debian.
