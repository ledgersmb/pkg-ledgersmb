Description: financial accounting and ERP program
 LedgerSMB is a double-entry financial accounting and Enterprise Resource
 Planning system which offers "Accounts Receivable", "Accounts Payable" and
 "General Ledger" tracking as well as inventory control and fixed assets
 handling. The LedgerSMB client can be a web browser or a programmed API call.
 The goal of the LedgerSMB project is to bring high quality ERP and accounting
 capabilities to Small and Midsize Businesses.
 .
 The application now defaults to being made available on port 5762 and being
 run directly by Starman instead of by Apache. If other access is also needed,
 a Reverse Proxy can be configured locally using Nginx or Apache, using the
 packages ledgersmb-apache or ledgersmb-nginx to select which. For more
 information, please see /usr/share/doc/ledgersmb/README.Debian.
