ledgersmb (1.3.46-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The default for the experimental dbconfig/debconf for configuring LedgerSMB
  during the package installation is to not use it; instead, the LedgerSMB
  database super-user can be manually created and that can then be used on the
  setup page at http://localhost/ledgersmb/setup.pl to create the company
  databases for use. See README.Debian for further information.

  The default for the contrib_dir directive in /etc/ledgersmb/ledgersmb.conf is
  now for PostgreSQL v9.4. The setting will need to be verified to be correct
  for the actual installed version of PostgreSQL before using LedgerSMB.
