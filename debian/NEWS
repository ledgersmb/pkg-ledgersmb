ledgersmb (1.4.30+ds-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  This represents the first upload to Debian of a LedgerSMB v1.4.x series
  package.

  The default is now to configure LedgerSMB during the package installation; 
  this is especially true for the DB Superuser name and password, which can
  also be redone at any time by running the doing the following at the command
  line: 'dpkg-reconfigure ledgersmb'.

  The /etc/ledgersmb/ledgersmb.conf and LedgerSMB Apache configuration file
  are now tracked and updated as necessary with package upgrades. You can
  view the differences between old and new configuration file versions and
  even in the case of upgrading from a version previous to this; it should
  allow you replace the old version with the new version and leave a copy
  of the old version named like "ledgersmb.conf.ucf-old".

  If this is an upgrade install from a 1.3.x series package, the application
  css directory is /var/lib/ledgersmb/css and defaults for the files were
  installed there from the example files during the previous package install
  and the configuration it set for them being there. If this is a new install,
  then the application css directory is at /usr/share/ledgersmb/css and the
  default configuration for the files is for them being there.
