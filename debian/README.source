Note that the original source archive is created by exporting the
relevant tagged version from the SVN repository and then creating
the archive from that.

This package uses dpatch to manage all modifications to the upstream
source.  Changes are stored in the source package as diffs in
debian/patches and applied during the build.

See /usr/share/doc/dpatch/README.source.gz for a detailed explanation.
