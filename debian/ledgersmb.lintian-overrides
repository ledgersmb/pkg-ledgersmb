# Upstream now includes an embedded copy of the Scriptaculous Javascript Library. There is a package for it
# available in Debian but not of the same version they are using. They have not done any testing but they
# do not use "a lot of advanced stuff" so it may work.  Override warning until it can be tested with the
# versions that are available in Debian.
