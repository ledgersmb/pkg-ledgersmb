debian/TODO for LedgerSMB v1.3

- If an 'apache2_invoke enmod' for the rewrite module is added to the
postinst section for apache 2.4; the restart of apache done for that
just hangs.  An apache reload done for 'apache2_invoke enconf' of the
2.4 apache configuration for ledgersmb.conf does seem to complete,
though shouldn't just do one or the other, with the restart overriding
the reload?

- A debian/po debconf Japanese translation has been provided. Currently,
there is no LSMB locale/po/ja.po file. Checked System|Lanaguage|List
Languages in LSMB 1.3.40: "ja" is not in the default list. It's also not
listed as an available language when editing templates, and presumably
those lists come from the same source. It can be added manually using
System|Language|Add Language.

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create the distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from
the source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to
create an HTML version?

- Create an HTML and/or PDF file of templateing/templating-guide.tex? And
then register it with doc-base?

- Now that versions of v1.4 are available; create a new package ledgersmb-1.3,
for any needed further support for v1.3.x versions of LedgerSMB.

- Instead of a sym link to point to the /etc/ledgersmb config file(s),
patch config file to add '/etc/' to the config file setting. (Would
the apache config need to be updated to allow that?)
