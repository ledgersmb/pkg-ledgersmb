debian/TODO for LedgerSMB v1.3


====================================================================================================


- There is now nginx/fcgiwrap related info: contrib/nginx-fcgiwrap/. At least, add
a reference to that information?

- Add something about plack, fcgi support & libplack-perl to README.Debian; at
  least to refer to the relevant readme.

- An Ubuntu bug was submitted about setup.pl not working after selecting
an automatic config during the install and setting a password:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1078817
- Created a Debian bug for the same issue, # 698298, & pointed the ubuntu bug
to that. Assigned the ubuntu bug to the Ubuntu LSMB team.
- The dbconfig-common based database configuration that is being used during
installations and upgrades needs to be reviewed and improved. It is capable
of creating the 'ledgersmb' database administrative user but it is not getting
created with the necessary permissions. It is also apparently automatically
creating a database named ledgersmb with the current way that user is being
created, which is not really needed for the application.

- http://i18n.debian.org/l10n-pkg-status/l/ledgersmb.html
Which listed this:
The following errors were found in ledgersmb 's PO files: 
gettext: locale/po/es_AR.po:2500: duplicate message definition...
locale/po/es_AR.po:248: ...this is the location of the first definition
msgfmt: found 1 fatal error
"Duplicate message definition in locale/po/es_AR.po"
https://sourceforge.net/p/ledger-smb/bugs/1096/

- A debian/po debconf Japanese translation has been provided. Currently,
there is no LSMB locale/po/ja.po file. Checked System|Lanaguage|List
Languages in LSMB 1.3.25: "ja" is not in the default list. It's also not
listed as an available language when editing templates, and presumably
those lists come from the same source. It can be added manually using
System|Language|Add Language.

- Most of the upstream locale/po/* files, and also how they are referenced in
debian/copyright, need to be reviewed and/or updated.  (LedgerSMB.pot was
updated with LedgerSMB v1.3.27)

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create the distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from
the source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to
create an HTML version?

- Create an HTML and/or PDF file of templateing/templating-guide.tex? And
then register it with doc-base?

- Add registration of at least database/ledgersmb.html to doc-base?

- Add a section regarding the web server setup to README.Debian?

- Add functionality in packaging to enable usage of nginx with LedgerSMB, 
at least including the creation of an example configuration file.

- Add an installation option for a versioned installation directory name?
Or add a package build time option to create a versioned package name and
installation? Or change to using at least binary package names that also
include info about the version, like "ledgersmb13" or "ledgersmb1.4" or
"ledgersmb-1.3"?

- Review the tools/* shell and perl scripts to determine what changes may be
necessary to make them usable on a Debian installation.
