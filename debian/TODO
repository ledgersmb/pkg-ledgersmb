debian/TODO for LedgerSMB v1.3

- The database configuration using dbconfig-common  is creating the ledgersmb user
but not with the correct permissions.  Standard setup uses something like this:
CREATE ROLE ledgersmb WITH SUPERUSER LOGIN NOINHERIT ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '$password';"

- The dbconfig configuration is apparantly automatically creating a database
named ledgersmb when it creates the ledgersmb user.  Is that really needed?

- Review the tools/* shell and perl scripts to see what if any need changes for
usage on a debian installation.

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from the
source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to create
an HTML version?

- The templates directory had been getting installed to /etc/ledgersmb/templates.
Should that be /var/lib/ledgersmb/templates instead?

- New 1.3 version of LedgerSMB contains an embedded javascript library. The
embedded version appears to be 1.8.2.  The library is available in Debian as the
package libjs-scriptaculous:  v1.8.1 in lenny (current oldstable), v1.8.3 in
lenny-backports, v1.8.3 in squeeze, v1.9.0 in wheezy. Provide a Lintian override
with description of issue, until otherwise resolved.
  From Chris Travers in the Ledger-smb-devel mailing list:
  "I don't know of any testing we have done on other versions.  We don't use a
   lot of advanced stuff so I would expect it would work.  If bugs are found,
   though, we can correct them."
Test usage of libjs-scriptaculous and change over to using that when it is found
to be operational with it.

- Apache v2.4 was released in February 2012 and is being prepared for upload into
Debian. Ref: http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/03/msg00013.html
at least regarding packaging guidelines.
