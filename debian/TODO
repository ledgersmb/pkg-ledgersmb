debian/TODO for LedgerSMB v1.2

- Autoconfigurtion for PostgreSQL and access to it by LedgerSMB

- Autoconfiguration of Apache2

- Suppress and/or otherwise handle the multiple instances of the following
Lintian warnings:
W: ledgersmb: executable-not-elf-or-script  (various directories)
W: ledgersmb: extra-license-file usr/share/ledgersmb/locale/legacy/

- It was announced back in Sept 2010 that LSMB v1.2 works with Postgresql v9,
which is now available in Debian Testing (wheezy). After testing that version
with LSMB, add v9.0 to the possible Postgresql versions in debian/control?
