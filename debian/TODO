debian/TODO for LedgerSMB v1.3

-> this may be resolved or resolvable with 1.3.19
- The package installs the LedgerSMB css directory to /var/lib/ledgersmb/css,
but the application itself currently expects it to be in the main installation
directory. The issue is at least partially resolved with v1.3.18 and v1.3.19.
(A symbolic link pointing to it is installed with the current packaging
as a workaround for the issue.)

- A review and translation process is underway for LedgerSMB debian/templates
and debian/po/*; do provided updates once that process has been completed.
Reference also # 674023, 676494 (cs.po), 678547 (de.po), 678265 (es.po),
677953 (fr.po),  678597 (gl.po), 678442 (it.po), 676511 (pl.po),
677839 (pt.po), 677793 (pt_BR.po), 676662 (ru.po), 678488 (sk.po),
and 676556 (sv.po).

-  Errors 'duplicate message definition' in locale/po/es_AR.po.  The author
(Andres) took a look at the issue and fixed it.  His changes were imported
and are likley to be available with upstream v1.3.20. Debian bug # 678281.

- The dbconfig configuration is apparently capable of creating the ledgersmb
user but it is not getting created with the necessary permissions. It is also
apparently automatically creating a database named ledgersmb when it creates
that user.  The owner of it can come up as postgres; should make that
ledgersmb, if that database is even needed.

-> If move where these are installed again, this may be moot.
- The initial default set of HTML/LaTeX/Text templates is being installed as
examples and copied to the /var/lib/ledgersmb/templates directory during the
initial package install.  Because example files over a certain size are 
automatically compressed, there may be files that have been compressed in that
default set of templates.  Example: invoice.tex.gz.
 
- Upstream uses pdflatex to create distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from the
source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to create
an HTML version?

- Create an HTML and/or PDF file of templateing/templating-guide.tex?  And
then register it with doc-base?

- Add registration of at least database/ledgersmb.html to doc-base?

- Review the tools/* shell and perl scripts to determine what changes may be
necessary to make them usable on a Debian installation.

- New 1.3 version of LedgerSMB contains an embedded javascript library. The
embedded version appears to be 1.8.2.  The library is available in Debian as the
package libjs-scriptaculous:  v1.8.1 in lenny, v1.8.3 in lenny-backports and
squeeze, v1.9.0 in wheezy and sid. Provide a Lintian override with description
of issue, until otherwise resolved.
  From Chris Travers in the Ledger-smb-devel mailing list:
  "I don't know of any testing we have done on other versions.  We don't use a
   lot of advanced stuff so I would expect it would work.  If bugs are found,
   though, we can correct them."
Test usage of libjs-scriptaculous and change over to using that when it is found
to be operational with it.
-> Instead of patching the files that use it directly, try using dh_linktree to
create the set of links to the debian packages.
