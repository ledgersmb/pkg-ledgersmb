debian/TODO for packaging LedgerSMB v1.4


================================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Discussed in IRC some of the permission fix issues.  Erik took care of
  fixing many of them in both master & 1.5 so when the next release comes out
  will need to run a build of ledgersmb for 1.4? without the fixes enabled
  in order to check how the fix permissions stanza in d/rules can be updated
  for that.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- LedgerSMB package for Debian Stretch, which is Debian v9 since being released,
is not currently available because it was removed due to depending on the 'dojo'
package which had been removed from Debian Testing ("Stretch") because of an RC
(Release Critical) bug.

  - The dojo package itself is still in unstable but it's only version 1.11.0
and the version 1.5.x series of LedgerSMB has been verified to be using version
1.12.2 of Dojo.

  - Debian bug to update ledgersmb package to 1.5.x series:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=874664

  - Debian bug for the RC bug in the dojo package, which is also merged with a bug
  to update the dojo package to its version 1.12.2:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=852923
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=869864

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The new debian/watch file works for 'uscan --report-status' but not when running
  the get-orig-source target in debian/rules, even in the current Debia unstable:

$ debian/rules get-orig-source
uscan --force-download --rename --destdir .
uscan: Newest version of ledgersmb on remote site is 1.5.12, local version is 1.4.42+ds
 (mangled local version is 1.4.42)
uscan:    => Newer package available from
      https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/archive/1.5.12.tar.gz
gpgv: Signature made Mon Sep 18 10:27:49 2017 UTC
gpgv:                using RSA key 39A629558DA0AF10
gpgv: BAD signature from "LedgerSMB Core Team (This is the key used for package signing.) <ledger-smb-core@lists.ledgersmb.org>"
uscan die: OpenPGP signature did not verify.
debian/rules:35: recipe for target 'get-orig-source' failed
make: *** [get-orig-source] Error 1

- Update debian/watch for new upstream location
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=868724

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Investigate again not using the Debian packaged dojo libraries.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- As per discussions in IRC, serveral in upstream do not think that the password
for the LSMB DB Admin user should be capable of getting changed after the package 
has initially been installed, much less that it can happen each time the package 
is upgraded as is currently the case. Note that functionality for being able to 
do such a password update using the upstream 'setup.pl' is being looked at,
reference https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/issues/2717. (But that may only
implemented for v1.6 and v1.4 isn't expected to get any more updates.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- A debian/po debconf Japanese translation has been provided. Currently,
there is no LSMB locale/po/ja.po file. Checked System|Lanaguage|List
Languages in LSMB 1.3.40: "ja" is not in the default list. It's also not
listed as an available language when editing templates, and presumably
those lists come from the same source. It can be added manually using
System|Language|Add Language.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- From Lintian:
I: ledgersmb source: testsuite-autopkgtest-missing
https://lintian.debian.org/tags/testsuite-autopkgtest-missing.html

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create the distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from
the source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to
create an HTML version?

- Create an HTML and/or PDF file of templateing/templating-guide.tex? And
then register it with doc-base?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Review the tools/* shell and perl scripts to determine what patches may be
necessary to make them usable on a Debian installation.
