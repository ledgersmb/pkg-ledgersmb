debian/TODO for LedgerSMB v1.3


- Use a patch to create an updated example of the ledgersmb.conf.default file
instead of the sed line in debian/rules, then create a copy of it as ledgersmb.conf
for installation to /etc/ledgersmb.

- Autoconfiguration of PostgreSQL and access to it by LedgerSMB using dbconfig-common.
Password for postgres superuser? For LedgerSMB admin?  Run prepare-company-database.sh
script?)

- Any post install processing for Apache2 should include "a2enmod rewrite" at some
point to ensure that module is enabled, and a restart as well because of the newly
installed /ledgersmb-httpd.conf.  (wwwconfig-common ?)

- Correct the following Lintian warnings:
W: ledgersmb source: out-of-date-standards-version 3.9.1 (current is 3.9.2)
W: ledgersmb source: debian-rules-missing-recommended-target build-arch
W: ledgersmb source: debian-rules-missing-recommended-target build-indep

- New 1.3 version contains an embedded javascript library
W: ledgersmb: extra-license-file usr/share/ledgersmb/UI/ajax/scriptaculous/MIT-LICENSE
W: ledgersmb: embedded-javascript-library usr/share/ledgersmb/UI/ajax/scriptaculous/lib/prototype.js
W: ledgersmb: embedded-javascript-library usr/share/ledgersmb/UI/ajax/scriptaculous/src/scriptaculous.js
-> embedded version appears to be 1.8.2.   It is available in Debian;  1.8.1 in lenny (current oldstable),
   1.8.3 in lenny-backports, 1.8.3 in squeeze, 1.9.0 in wheezy
p   libjs-scriptaculous  - JavaScript library for dynamic web applications 

- Suppress and/or otherwise handle the multiple instances of the following
Lintian warnings:
W: ledgersmb: executable-not-elf-or-script  (various directories)
W: ledgersmb: extra-license-file usr/share/ledgersmb/locale/legacy/

- It was announced back in Sept 2010 that LSMB v1.2 works with Postgresql v9,
which is now available in Debian Testing (wheezy).   After testing that version
with LSMB, add v9.0 to the possible Postgresql versions in debian/control. There 
are different needs for the v8 & v9 Postgresql.

- As neccessary, add any other docs that could be registered to doc-base files.
