debian/TODO for LedgerSMB v1.4


====================================================================================================

Update debian/Readme.Debian
Update debian/Readme.sources

review locale/po/* files for updating debian/copyright as necessary

- Add a get-orig-source target added to debian rules ?

----------------------------------------------------
- some apache configs (mpm?)  use cgid instead of cgi;  change postinst to 
  do the test for which is already enabled depending on if mpm is enabled?

----------------------------------------------------

Now running lintian... ( v1.4.20+ds-0jessie1 )
	- These seem to be missing the short description and the 'dash' sign after the "NAME" entry
	in source Perl file.

N: 
N:    Each manual page should start with a "NAME" section, which lists the
N:    name and a brief description of the page separated by "\-". The "NAME"
N:    section is parsed by lexgrog and used to generate a database that's
N:    queried by commands like apropos and whatis. This tag indicates that
N:    lexgrog was unable to parse the NAME section of this manual page.
N:    
N:    For manual pages that document multiple programs, functions, files, or
N:    other things, the part before "\-" should list each separated by a comma
N:    and a space. Each thing listed must not contain spaces; a man page for a
N:    two-part command like "fs listacl" must use something like "fs_listacl"
N:    in the "NAME" section so that it can be parsed by lexgrog.
N:    
N:    Refer to the lexgrog(1) manual page, the groff_man(7) manual page, and
N:    the groff_mdoc(7) manual page for details.

- debian/watch: expand the uversionmangle regular expression to exclude the v1.2
and v1.3 versions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Instead of (or along with?) having the package install symlinks for accessing the
dojo libraries, use Aliases in the Apache config, something like this?

    Alias /ledgersmb/UI/lib/dojo/dojo /usr/share/javascript/dojo
    Alias /ledgersmb/UI/lib/dojo/dojox /usr/share/javascript/dojox
    Alias /ledgersmb/UI/lib/dojo/dijit /usr/share/javascript/dijir

It would only be useful for those installs using Apache directly, not as a proxy,
but that is currently the default.

This issue happened after upgrade from 15.04 to 15.10

ProblemType: Package

Package: ledgersmb 1.3.46-1
Uname: Linux 4.2.3-040203-generic x86_64
ApportVersion: 2.19.1-0ubuntu4

Title: package ledgersmb 1.3.46-1 failed to install/upgrade: subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 2
UpgradeStatus: No upgrade log present (probably fresh install)

Setting up ledgersmb (1.3.46-1) ...
Installing new version of config file /etc/ledgersmb/ledgersmb.conf ...

apache2_reload: AH00526: Syntax error on line 9 of /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/ledgersmb.conf:
apache2_reload: Invalid command 'RewriteEngine', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module
not included in the server configuration

That line 9 is the "RewriteEngine On" line.  That error might come up rewrite mod
 wasn't enabled in apache, but this happened during an upgrade from v15.04 to v15.10,
 where apache and ledgersmb were already installed and operational and therefore the
 rewrite mod should already have been enabled in apache.

- A debian/po debconf Japanese translation has been provided. Currently,
there is no LSMB locale/po/ja.po file. Checked System|Lanaguage|List
Languages in LSMB 1.3.40: "ja" is not in the default list. It's also not
listed as an available language when editing templates, and presumably
those lists come from the same source. It can be added manually using
System|Language|Add Language. 

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create the distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from
the source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to
create an HTML version?

- Create an HTML and/or PDF file of templateing/templating-guide.tex? And
then register it with doc-base?

- Review the tools/* shell and perl scripts to determine what patches may be
necessary to make them usable on a Debian installation. 

- Instead of a sym link to point to the /etc/ledgersmb config file(s), 
patch config file to add '/etc/' to the config file setting. (Would
the apache config also need to be updated to allow that?)
