debian/TODO for LedgerSMB v1.4


====================================================================================================

- A debian/po debconf Japanese translation has been provided. Currently,
there is no LSMB locale/po/ja.po file. Checked System|Lanaguage|List
Languages in LSMB 1.3.40: "ja" is not in the default list. It's also not
listed as an available language when editing templates, and presumably
those lists come from the same source. It can be added manually using
System|Language|Add Language.

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create the distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from
the source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to
create an HTML version?

- Create an HTML and/or PDF file of templateing/templating-guide.tex? And
then register it with doc-base?

- Review the tools/* shell and perl scripts to determine what patches may be
necessary to make them usable on a Debian installation. 

- Instead of a sym link to point to the /etc/ledgersmb config file(s),
patch config file to add '/etc/' to the config file setting. (Would
the apache config need to be updated to allow that?)
