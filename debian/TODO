debian/TODO for LedgerSMB v1.3

- The package installs the LedgerSMB css directory to /var/lib/ledgersmb/css,
but the application itself currently expects it to be in the main installation
directory. The issue at least partially resolved with v1.3.18 and v1.3.19.
(A symbolic link pointing to it is installed with the current packaging
as a workaround for the issue.)

- A review and translation process is underway for LedgerSMB debian/templates
and debian/po/*; do updates provided by debian-l10n-english once that process
has been completed. Reference also # 674023, 676494 (cs.po), 676511 (pl.po),
676556 (sv.po), and 676662 (ru.po).

- The application UPGRADE file does not really need to be installed with the
package?  Any useful information could be moved to README.Debian.

- The dbconfig configuration is apparently capable of creating the ledgersmb
user but it is not getting created with the necessary permissions. It is also
apparently automatically creating a database named ledgersmb when it creates
that user.  The owner of it can come up as postgres; should make that
ledgersmb, if that database is even needed.

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from the
source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to create
an HTML version?

- Create an HTML and/or PDF file of templateing/templating-guide.tex?  And
then register it with doc-base?

- Add registration of at least database/ledgersmb.html to doc-base?

- Review the tools/* shell and perl scripts to determine what changes may be
necessary to make them usable on a Debian installation.

- New 1.3 version of LedgerSMB contains an embedded javascript library. The
embedded version appears to be 1.8.2.  The library is available in Debian as the
package libjs-scriptaculous:  v1.8.1 in lenny, v1.8.3 in lenny-backports and
squeeze, v1.9.0 in wheezy and sid. Provide a Lintian override with description
of issue, until otherwise resolved.
  From Chris Travers in the Ledger-smb-devel mailing list:
  "I don't know of any testing we have done on other versions.  We don't use a
   lot of advanced stuff so I would expect it would work.  If bugs are found,
   though, we can correct them."
Test usage of libjs-scriptaculous and change over to using that when it is found
to be operational with it.
-> Instead of patching the files that use it directly, try using dh_linktree to
create the set of links to the debian packages.
