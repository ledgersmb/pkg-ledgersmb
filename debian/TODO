debian/TODO for LedgerSMB v1.3

- Add libexcel-template-plus-perl and libtemplate-plugin-latex-perl to at
least Suggests in debian/control.

- The dbconfig configuration is apparently capable of creating the ledgersmb
user but it is not getting created with the necessary permissions. It is also
apparently automatically creating a database named ledgersmb when it creates
that user.  The owner of it can come up as postgres; should make that
ledgersmb, if the database is even needed.

- Review the tools/* shell and perl scripts to see what if any need changes for
usage on a Debian installation.

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from the
source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to create
an HTML version?

- The package installs the LedgerSMB css directory to /var/lib/ledgersmb/css,
but the application itself currently expects it to be in the main installation
directory; reference also upstream bug # 3516730. (A symbolic link pointing to
it is installed with the current packaging as a workaround for the issue.)

- The templates directory has been getting installed to the directory
/etc/ledgersmb/templates. Should that be /var/lib/ledgersmb/templates instead?

- New 1.3 version of LedgerSMB contains an embedded javascript library. The
embedded version appears to be 1.8.2.  The library is available in Debian as the
package libjs-scriptaculous:  v1.8.1 in lenny (current oldstable), v1.8.3 in
lenny-backports and squeeze, v1.9.0 in wheezy and sid. Provide a Lintian override
with description of issue, until otherwise resolved.
  From Chris Travers in the Ledger-smb-devel mailing list:
  "I don't know of any testing we have done on other versions.  We don't use a
   lot of advanced stuff so I would expect it would work.  If bugs are found,
   though, we can correct them."
Test usage of libjs-scriptaculous and change over to using that when it is found
to be operational with it.

- Apache v2.4 was released in February 2012 and is being prepared for upload into
Debian. Ref: http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/03/msg00013.html
at least regarding packaging guidelines.
