debian/TODO for packaging LedgerSMB v1.4


================================================================================

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- LedgerSMB package for Debian Stretch, which will be Debian v9 when it is released,
is not currently available because it was removed due to depending on the 'dojo'
package which had been removed from Debian Testing ("Stretch") because of an RC
(Release Critical) bug.
Reference; https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/issues/2704

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Investigate again not using the Debian packaged dojo libraries.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- debian/watch: expand the uversionmangle regular expression to exclude v1.2,
v1.3, and v1.5 versions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- As per discussions in IRC, serveral in upstream do not think that the password
for the LSMB DB Admin user should be capable of getting changed after the package has
initially been installed, much less that it can happen each time the package is
upgraded as is currently the case. Note that functionality for being able to do
such a password update using the upstream 'setup.pl' is being looked at,
reference https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/issues/2717.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- A debian/po debconf Japanese translation has been provided. Currently,
there is no LSMB locale/po/ja.po file. Checked System|Lanaguage|List
Languages in LSMB 1.3.40: "ja" is not in the default list. It's also not
listed as an available language when editing templates, and presumably
those lists come from the same source. It can be added manually using
System|Language|Add Language. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create the distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from
the source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to
create an HTML version?

- Create an HTML and/or PDF file of templateing/templating-guide.tex? And
then register it with doc-base?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Review the tools/* shell and perl scripts to determine what patches may be
necessary to make them usable on a Debian installation. 

- Instead of a sym link to point to the /etc/ledgersmb config file(s), 
patch config file to add '/etc/' to the config file setting? (Would
the apache config also need to be updated to allow that?)
