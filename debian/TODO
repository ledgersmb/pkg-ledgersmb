debian/TODO for LedgerSMB v1.3

- The dbconfig-common based database configuration that is being used during
installations and upgrades needs to be reviewed and improved. It is capable
of creating the 'ledgersmb' database administrative user but it is not getting
created with the necessary permissions. It is also apparently automatically
creating a database named ledgersmb with the current way that user is being
created, which is not really needed for the application.

- Most of the upstream locale/po/* files need to be reviewed and/or updated;
several of the files have fatal errors in them which need to be resolved.

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from the
source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to create
an HTML version?

- Create an HTML and/or PDF file of templateing/templating-guide.tex? And
then register it with doc-base?

- Add registration of at least database/ledgersmb.html to doc-base?

- The doc/release-notes file is getting installed with the package; should it
be referenced in README.Debian?

- Add installation option for a versioned directory name? Or add a package
build time option to create a versioned package name?

- Review the tools/* shell and perl scripts to determine what changes may be
necessary to make them usable on a Debian installation.

- New 1.3 version of LedgerSMB contains an embedded javascript library. The
embedded version appears to be 1.8.2.  The library is available in Debian as the
package libjs-scriptaculous:  v1.8.1 in lenny, v1.8.3 in lenny-backports and
squeeze, v1.9.0 in wheezy and sid. Provide a Lintian override with description
of issue, until otherwise resolved.
  From Chris Travers in the Ledger-smb-devel mailing list:
  "I don't know of any testing we have done on other versions.  We don't use a
   lot of advanced stuff so I would expect it would work.  If bugs are found,
   though, we can correct them."
Test usage of libjs-scriptaculous and change over to using that when it is found
to be operational with it.
-> Instead of patching the files that use it directly, try using dh_linktree to
create the set of links to the debian packages?
