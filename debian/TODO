debian/TODO for LedgerSMB v1.4


====================================================================================================

Update debian/Readme.Debian
Update debian/Readme.sources

review locale/po/* files for updating debian/copyright as necessary

- need to add a get-orig-source target added to debian rules ?

----------------------------------------------------
	- some apache config (mpm?)  use cgid instead of cgi;  change postinst to 
	to the test for which is already enabled depending on if mpm is enabled?

----------------------------------------------------

Now running lintian...

	- these seem to be missing the short description and the 'dash' sign after the "NAME" entry.

W: ledgersmb: manpage-has-bad-whatis-entry usr/share/man/man3/LedgerSMB::App_State.3pm.gz
N: 
N:    Each manual page should start with a "NAME" section, which lists the
N:    name and a brief description of the page separated by "\-". The "NAME"
N:    section is parsed by lexgrog and used to generate a database that's
N:    queried by commands like apropos and whatis. This tag indicates that
N:    lexgrog was unable to parse the NAME section of this manual page.
N:    
N:    For manual pages that document multiple programs, functions, files, or
N:    other things, the part before "\-" should list each separated by a comma
N:    and a space. Each thing listed must not contain spaces; a man page for a
N:    two-part command like "fs listacl" must use something like "fs_listacl"
N:    in the "NAME" section so that it can be parsed by lexgrog.
N:    
N:    Refer to the lexgrog(1) manual page, the groff_man(7) manual page, and
N:    the groff_mdoc(7) manual page for details.

N:    with the #! sequence that marks interpreted scripts. It might be a sh

N:    marked unnecessarily as executable on other systems.

N:    If you are using debhelper to build your package, running dh_fixperms
N:    will often correct this problem for you.

-	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ledgersmb/+bug/1473318
- reported against v15.04 (vivid)		
- TMK; already resolved with LSMB 1.3.46-1, available in in what will be v15.10 (wily)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- A debian/po debconf Japanese translation has been provided. Currently,
there is no LSMB locale/po/ja.po file. Checked System|Lanaguage|List
Languages in LSMB 1.3.40: "ja" is not in the default list. It's also not
listed as an available language when editing templates, and presumably
those lists come from the same source. It can be added manually using
System|Language|Add Language. 

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create the distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from
the source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to
create an HTML version?

- Create an HTML and/or PDF file of templateing/templating-guide.tex? And
then register it with doc-base?

- Review the tools/* shell and perl scripts to determine what patches may be
necessary to make them usable on a Debian installation. 

- Instead of a sym link to point to the /etc/ledgersmb config file(s), 
patch config file to add '/etc/' to the config file setting. (Would
the apache config need to be updated to allow that?)
